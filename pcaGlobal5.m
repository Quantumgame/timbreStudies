% transforms a n*p1 data matrix by computing its principal components, 
% keeping the p2 first components such that their cumulated variance > varThresh, 
% and projecting the old data onto the new, smaller-dimension space
% PCA is computed with Halko et al.'s fast truncated SVD
% inputs:
% - data: a n*p1 matrix of n observations in dimension p1
% - varThresh: a float between 0-1 corresponding to the minimum percentage
% of total variance that is preserved in the smaller-dimension space (the
% larger the threshold, the more principal components are kept)
% outputs: 
% - new_data: a n*p2 matrix of n observations (same order as data) in the
% new space (p2 < p1)
